# 💓 Heart Disease Risk Prediction Web App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-entered medical attributes. Built with **Flask**, **Python**, and a **Random Forest Classifier**, this project combines data science, web development, and healthcare education.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This web app allows users to input their health data—like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.—and get a prediction about their heart disease risk. It also includes an information page to educate users about the medical relevance and safe ranges of each input field.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Trained ML model using a Kaggle heart disease dataset
- 🧾 User-friendly web form with real-time validation
- 📊 Educational info page for health awareness
- 🎯 Clean, responsive, and interactive UI
- 💾 Model training using `scikit-learn` and `GridSearchCV`

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap (for styling)
